Physics lessons 

Teaching content credits go to Jean-Marie Mercier, former Physics teacher at Lyc√©e Pierre de Fermat, Toulouse. 

Source does not built yet, since I lost the package (sty), which has to be rewritten. 

I don't have the time for it now. 

BUILD : just run make clean all

The build MUST not use pdflatex. 

commits which require pdflatex will all be rejected. 

bibtex, latex, divps and ps2pdf are the only allowed and necessary command lines for this project.
